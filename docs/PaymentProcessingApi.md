Authorisation

An authorisation process performs a standard transaction authorisation based on the provided parameters of its request. The CityPay gateway will route your transaction via an Acquiring bank for subsequent authorisation to the appropriate card  schemes such as Visa or MasterCard.  The authorisation API should be used for server environments to process transactions on demand and in realtime.   The authorisation API can be used for multiple types of transactions including E-commerce, mail order, telephone order, customer present (keyed), continuous authority, pre-authorisation and others. CityPay will configure your account for  the appropriate coding and this will perform transparently by the gateway.   Data properties that are required, may depend on the environment you are conducting payment for. Our API aims to be  flexible enough to cater for these structures. Our integration team will aid you in providing the necessary data to   transact.    ### E-commerce workflows   For E-commerce transactions requiring 3DSv1 and 3DSv2 transactions, the API contains a fully accredited in built mechanism to handle authentication.  The gateway has been accredited extensively with both Acquirers and Card Schemes and simplifies the nature of these calls into a simple structure for authentication, preventing integrators from performing lengthy and a costly accreditation with Visa and MasterCard.  3D-secure has been around for a number of years and aims to shift the liability of a transaction away from a merchant back to the card holder. A *liability shift* determines whether a card holder can charge back a transaction as unknown. Effectively the process asks for a card holder to authenticate the transaction prior to authorisation producing a Cardholder  verification value (CAVV) as evidence of authorisation.   #### 3DSv1  ```json {    \"AuthenticationRequired\": {     \"acsurl\": \"https://bank.com/3DS/ACS\",     \"pareq\": \"SXQgd2FzIHRoZSBiZXN0IG9mIHRpbWVzLCBpdCB3YXMgdGhlIHdvcnN00...\",     \"md\": \"WQgZXZlcnl0aGluZyBiZW\"   }                } ```  ```xml <AuthenticationRequired>  <acsurl>https://bank.com/3DS/ACS</acsurl>  <pareq>SXQgd2FzIHRoZSBiZXN0IG9mIHRpbWVzLCBpdCB3YXMgdGhlIHdvcnN00...</pareq>  <md>WQgZXZlcnl0aGluZyBiZW</md> </AuthenticationRequired> ```  For E-commerce transactions requiring 3DSv1, the API contains a built in MPI which will be called to check whether the  card is participating in 3DSv1 with Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode. Should the card be enrolled, a payer  request (PAReq) value will be created and forwarded back as [authentication required](#authenticationrequired) response.   Your system will need to process this authentication  requirement to forward the end user's browser to an authentication server (ACS) to gain the user's authentication. The ACS will then perform a HTTP post back to your online site which should be forwarded back to this API for subsequent authorisation.   Please note that 3DSv1 is being phased out due to changes to strong customer authentication mechanisms. 3DSv2 addresses this and will solidify the authorisation and confirmation process.  #### 3DSv2  ```json {    \"RequestChallenged\": {     \"acsurl\": \"https://bank.com/3DS/ACS\",     \"creq\": \"SXQgd2FzIHRoZSBiZXN0IG9mIHRpbWVzLCBpdCB3YXMgdGhlIHdvcnN00...\"   }                } ```  ```xml <RequestChallenged>  <acsurl>https://bank.com/3DS/ACS</acsurl>  <creq>SXQgd2FzIHRoZSBiZXN0IG9mIHRpbWVzLCBpdCB3YXMgdGhlIHdvcnN00...</creq> </RequestChallenged> ```  All merchants in the EEC will require to migrate their E-commerce transactions to a secure customer authentication  model (SCA) throughout 2020. This has been adopted by the payments industry as a progressive move alongside the European  Unions payments directive.  CityPay support 3DSv2 for Verified by Visa, MasterCard Identity Check and American Express SafeKey 2.0 and will be rolling out acquirers on the new platform from Q2 2020. The new enhancement to 3DSv2 will allow for CityPay to seamlessly authenticate transactions in a \"frictionless\" flowed method which will authenticate low risk transactions with minimal impact to a  standard authorisation flow. Our API simply performs this on behalf of the merchant and cardholder.  Should a transaction however be \"challenged\" the API will return a [request challenge](#requestchallenged) which will  require your integration to forward the cardholder's browser to the given [ACS url](#acsurl) by posting the [creq](#creq) value. Once complete, the ACS will have already been in touch with our servers by sending us a result of the authentication. Our servers however will be awaiting confirmation that the authorisation should continue and on receipt of a [cres](#cres) value, the flow will perform a full authorisation.   Please note that the CRes returned to us is purely a mechanism of acknowledging that transactions should be committed for authorisation. The ACS by this point will have sent us the verification value (CAVV) to perform a liability shift. The CRes value will be validated for receipt of this value and subsequently may return back response codes illustrating this.

# **CaptureRequest**
> Acknowledgement CaptureRequest (InlineObject2 inlineObject2)

Capture

_The capture process only applies to transactions which have been pre-authorised only._   The capture process will ensure that a transaction will now settle. It is expected that a capture call will be provided within 3 days or a maximum of 7 days.  A capture request is provided to confirm that you wish the transaction to be settled. This request can contain a final amount for the transaction which is different to the original authorisation amount. This may be useful in a delayed system process such as waiting for stock to be ordered, confirmed, or services provided before the final cost is known.  When a transaction is completed, a new authorisation code may be created and a new confirmation can be sent online to the acquiring bank.  Once the transaction has been processed. A standard [`Acknowledgement`](#acknowledgement) will be returned, outlining the result of the transaction. On a successful completion process, the transaction will be available for the settlement and completed at the end of the day.

# **RetrievalRequest**
> AuthReferences RetrievalRequest (InlineObject7 inlineObject7)

Retrieval

A retrieval request which allows an integration to obtain the result of a transaction processed in the last 90 days. The request allows for retrieval based on the identifier or transaction  number.   The process may return multiple results in particular where a transaction was processed multiple times against the same identifier. This can happen if errors were first received. The API therefore returns up to the first 5 transactions in the latest date time order.  It is not intended for this operation to be a replacement for reporting and only allows for base transaction information to be returned. 

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CityPayAPI.Api;
using CityPayAPI.Client;
using CityPayAPI.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class RetrievalRequestExample
    {

        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://api.citypay.com/v6";
            // Configure API key authorization: cp-api-key
            config.AddApiKey("cp-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("cp-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new PaymentProcessingApi(config);
            var inlineObject7 = new InlineObject7(); // InlineObject7 | 

            try
            {
                // Retrieval
                AuthReferences result = apiInstance.RetrievalRequest(inlineObject7);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling PaymentProcessingApi.RetrievalRequest: " + e.Message );
                Debug.Print("Status Code: "+ e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }

# **VoidRequest**
> Acknowledgement VoidRequest (InlineObject5 inlineObject5)

Void

_The void process generally applies to transactions which have been pre-authorised only however voids can occur  on the same day if performed before batching and settlement._   The void process will ensure that a transaction will now settle. It is expected that a void call will be  provided on the same day before batching and settlement or within 3 days or within a maximum of 7 days.  Once the transaction has been processed as a void, an [`Acknowledgement`](#acknowledgement) will be returned, outlining the result of the transaction.
