/*
 * CityPay Payment API
 *
 *  This CityPay API is an HTTP RESTful payment API used for direct server to server transactional processing. It provides a number of payment mechanisms including: Internet, MOTO, Continuous Authority transaction processing, 3-D Secure decision handling using RFA Secure, Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids and Completion processing. The API is also capable of tokenized payments using cardholder Accounts.  ## Compliance and Security Your application will need to adhere to PCI-DSS standards to operate safely and to meet requirements set out by  Visa and MasterCard and the PCI Security Standards Council. These include  * Data must be collected using TLS version 1.2 using [strong cryptography](https://citypay.github.io/api-docs/payment-api/#enabled-tls-ciphers). We will not accept calls to our API at   lower grade encryption levels. We regularly scan our TLS endpoints for vulnerabilities and perform TLS assessments   as part of our compliance program. * The application must not store sensitive cardholder data (CHD) such as the card security code (CSC) or   primary access number (PAN) * The application must not display the full card number on receipts, it is recommended to mask the PAN   and show the last 4 digits. The API will return this for you for ease of receipt creation * If you are developing a website, you will be required to perform regular scans on the network where you host the   application to meet your compliance obligations * You will be required to be PCI Compliant and the application must adhere to the security standard. Further information   is available from [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) * The API verifies that the request is for a valid account and originates from a trusted source using the remote IP   address. Our application firewalls analyse data that may be an attempt to break a large number of security common   security vulnerabilities.

We only provide an obfuscated value in logging and reporting.  The plaintext value is encrypted in our database using AES 256 GMC bit encryption for settlement or refund purposes.  When providing the card number to our gateway through the authorisation API you will be handling the card data on your application. This will require further PCI controls to be in place and this value must never be stored.  (required).</param>

The value helps to identify posession of the card as it is not available within the chip or magnetic swipe.  When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped out by any integer parsing.  The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.  Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.  The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.  This applies to all entities handling card data.  It should also not be used in any hashing process.  CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed. For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm. .</param>

Values are  &#x60;0&#x60; for the default policy (default value if not supplied).

Tags can help you group transactions together based on certain criteria, like a work job or a ticket number. They can also assist in filtering transactions when you&#39;re generating reports.  Multiple Tags You can add more than one tag to a transaction by separating them with commas.  Limitations There is a maximum limit of 3 tags that can be added to a single transaction. Each tag can be no longer than 20 characters and alphanumeric with no spaces.  Example: Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a software company and you have different teams working on various projects. When a team makes a purchase or incurs an expense, they can tag the transaction with the project name, the team name, and the type of expense.  Project Name: Project_X Team Name: Team_A Type of Expense: Hardware So, the tag for a transaction might look like: Project_X,Team_A,Hardware  This way, when you&#39;re looking at your financial reports, you can easily filter transactions based on these tags to see how much each project or team is spending on different types of expenses. .</param>

They can also assist in filtering transactions when you&#39;re generating reports.  Multiple Tags You can add more than one tag to a transaction by separating them with commas.  Limitations There is a maximum limit of 3 tags that can be added to a single transaction. Each tag can be no longer than 20 characters and alphanumeric with no spaces.  Example: Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a software company and you have different teams working on various projects. When a team makes a purchase or incurs an expense, they can tag the transaction with the project name, the team name, and the type of expense.  Project Name: Project_X Team Name: Team_A Type of Expense: Hardware So, the tag for a transaction might look like: Project_X,Team_A,Hardware  This way, when you&#39;re looking at your financial reports, you can easily filter transactions based on these tags to see how much each project or team is spending on different types of expenses.
